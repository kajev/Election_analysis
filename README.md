### Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.

The purpose of this election audit is to analyze where the votes went to and the percentages of voters that each candidate received. To add to this we also observed what counties of the region voted for the candidates and the turnout rate for each county.

### Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

* Denver had the largest county turnout, possibly due to the larger population there
* Denver won by a landslide while other counties barely compared
* Diana DeGette seems to be the winning candidate, once again by a landslide
* Charles did well in second, although only getting ~20%

### Election-Audit Summary
This code can be used to analyze voting regions and how many people go out to vote. 
This also helps to visualize where the votes are coming from so politicians looking for votes can focus on these regions.
With some more altercations, you can observe trends over years to see where the winning politician gets their votes from.
